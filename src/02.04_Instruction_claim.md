# Writing an instruction: claim

The final instruction we need to write is `claim`.
This instruction allows a vesting contract _owner_ to claim there assets when those unvest.
The design and implementation process will be mostly similar to the previous section.
Therefore we'll go a bit faster here and slow down when there are interesting considerations to ponder.

## Adding the skeleton for a new instruction

We begin by duplicating the `create.rs` file, renaming it to `claim.rs`, declairing the module in `processor.rs` and wiping our `create.rs` business logic.
An alternative would have been to keep the example instruction and restart from there, but it doesn't make much of a difference.

We won't be needing parameters here : we'll simply extract as many tokens as possible from the vesting contract.
The `Params` struct will be empty but we'll use the casting logic anyways.
I have gone ahead and implemented the instruction.
You can read through the annotated code:

```rust,noplayground
//! Claim unvested tokens

use bonfida_utils::checks::{check_account_key, check_account_owner, check_signer};
use bytemuck::{Pod, Zeroable};
use solana_program::{clock::Clock, msg, program::invoke_signed, sysvar::Sysvar};

use crate::state::{self, vesting_contract::VestingContract};

use {
    bonfida_utils::InstructionsAccount,
    solana_program::{
        account_info::{next_account_info, AccountInfo},
        entrypoint::ProgramResult,
        program_error::ProgramError,
        pubkey::Pubkey,
    },
};

        let accounts = Accounts {

        Ok(accounts)

}

        return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
    }

        &[
            &accounts.vesting_contract.key.to_bytes(),
            &[vesting_contract.header.signer_nonce as u8],

    // out of our loop. Not doing this would leave the contract empty but in a weird state
    let current_schedule_index = vesting_contract.header.current_schedule_index as usize;
    vesting_contract.header.current_schedule_index = u64::MAX;

    for (idx, s) in vesting_contract.schedules[current_schedule_index..]
        .iter_mut()
        .enumerate()
    {
        if s.unlock_timestamp > current_timestamp {
            // We update the current_schedule_index for the next call to claim
            // This prevents the same quantity from being unlocked twice

        // update the current_schedule_index. Defense in depth.
        s.quantity = 0;
    }

    let transfer_instruction = spl_token::instruction::transfer(
        &spl_token::ID,
        accounts.vault.key,
        accounts.destination_token_account.key,

    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```
 Once this is done, we need to add this instruction and its binding to the `instruction.rs` enum as well as `processor.rs`.

 In `instruction.rs`, we add the `Claim` variant to the `ProgramInstruction` enum. We also add the following binding:
 ```rust,noplayground
 pub fn claim(accounts: claim::Accounts<Pubkey>, params: claim::Params) -> Instruction {
    accounts.get_instruction_cast(crate::ID, ProgramInstruction::Claim as u8, params)
}
 ```
 In order for this binding to compile, you need to add the `instruction_params_casting` feature to the `bonfida-utils` dependency in your `Cargo.toml`.

 In `processor.rs`, we add the following match variant:
 ```rust,noplayground
    ProgramInstruction::Claim => {
    msg!("Instruction: Claim");
    let params = bytemuck::from_bytes(instruction_data);
    claim::process(program_id, accounts, params)?;
}
 ```

 The `bytemuck::from_bytes` logic isn't strictly necessary here, and in practice you would omit it.

 With this, the entire logic of our program is done!
 The next step is to add some basic integration tests.
