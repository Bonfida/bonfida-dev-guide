# Patching a vulnerability

As mentioned in the previous section, our program in its current state has a major vulnerability.
It enables a malicious issuer to dupe a recipient into thinking they trustlessly own vested assets, when in reality they don't.
Let's apply a methodical approach to find this vulnerability.

## Thinking about attack vectors

Very broadly speaking, a vulnerability exists when there is some way to manipulate a program's inputs to make it behave in _unexpected_ ways.
This means that patching vulnerabilities means looking at a program's inputs and making sure that those are safe.
Solana programs have two different kinds of input with different security implications:
- Instruction data
- Account data
- System variables
