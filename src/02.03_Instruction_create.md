# Writing an instruction: create

In the previous sections, we have defined our program's main data structure `VestingContract`.
The next step is to write our program's one of two main primitives: `create`.

We'll start by renaming the `src/processor/example_instr.rs` file to `create.rs`.
Similarly we'll rename the `ExampleInstr` variant of the `instruction::ProgramInstruction` enum to `Create`, and the `instruction::example` binding to `create`.
We should also alter the log message in `processor.rs` from `"Instruction: Example Instruction"` to `"Instruction: Create"`, and update the instruction comment at the top of `create.rs` to `//! Create a new token vesting contract`.

This primtive will perform several operations:

- Initialize a new `VestingContract` account/object.
- Configure the `VestingContract` with user-provided parameters.
- Transfer funds into the program vault.

An instruction's specification is defined by its `Accounts` and `Params` objects. Let's start by thinking about what kinds of accounts we'll need, and then we'll take a look at the associated parameters.
